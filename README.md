Credits go to LAX1DUDE for the original Five Nights At Winston's (FNAW). Also for the original Eaglercraft.
Credits to whoever made Resent Client. If you know, tell me to update this README. 
Credits also go to who made Pi Client. Note: It is a hacked client, don't abuse the cheats and I do not recommend you use PiClient if you want to play Eaglercraft correctly.
"index.html" is Resent client. The others are self-explanatory.
Credits to @A3R10 for N0VA client. The EPK file is my world that I made in N0VA client.
